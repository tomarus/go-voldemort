go-voldemort
============

### STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - EXPECT CHANGES

Voldermort client written in Go

The client allows you to either use nice ready made methods (get/put etc) or expose the Voldemort protobufs objects to create your own requests.

There are advantages to both but you need to understand why you are choosing one over the other so I suggest you give the Voldemort wiki a good read first - the link is at the bottom.

adding updates for latest version of voldemort.
updating protobufs. this package was using the older protobufs project. 
adding support to manage all the latest functionality from the voldemort team.
